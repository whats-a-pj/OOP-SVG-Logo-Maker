# OOP SVG Logo Maker
This project was created to help small businesses or really any individual with creating a professional svg image logo, making it scalable to any size while keeping it's quality. All you have to do is answer a few questions and the file is generated for you! This could come in handy when creating some logo mockups or just simply so you don't have to break the bank finding someone to create such a simple logo design.

I had help from Jacek Hacking (TA) and Trever Oveson (TA) during office hours (before and after class) to understand why the shapes themselves weren't being created, I had enough code already written that it didn't take too long to understand the problem.

I had a study group with Brian Whisler, Jeremy Rapich and Salvador Mejia on 8/27 to look over Jest in each other's code, as we each wrote our shapes.js file differently from each other as well as talk about the last week's classes.

I had help from Oscarlos Gomez Rosario with AskBCS to understand why my original Jest tests weren't passing, turns out once again- I did have the right idea and enough code to set things right, I just needed to re-add my describe functions I originally had.
